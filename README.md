# Convolutional-Neural-Network
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow 2.x to classify images of dogs and cats. The dataset includes 8005 training and 2023 testing images. The workflow covers data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and performance tuning. The goal is to achieve high classification accuracy through effective CNN architecture and model optimization techniques.
